Sample Code / Demos Used: <br>
Basic MVC, SwitchScenes, Audio 

Note: <br>
- If 1,2,3 are pressed during the game, the level selected will start <br>
- If ENTER is pressed during a game, the game will restart at level 1 

*This was done to make it easier to test between levels but in a real game could be prevented by checking if a game is in progress with a flag*
